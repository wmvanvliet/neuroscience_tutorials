    "# 4. Classifying the P300\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tutorial covered visualizing the P300 potential through an ERP plot. This tutorial covers the classification of the P300 potential. The EEG recording used here is made of a subject that is presented with a screen containing 6 icons. These icons were highlighted one by one. For each trial, each icon was highlighted a total of 10 times. The subject selected one of the icons and mentally counted the number of times the chosen icon was highlighted (which was ofcourse always 10), a task designed to keep him focussed on this icon. Every time the chosen icon, which I will refer to now as the target, was highlighted, a P300 potential occurs in the EEG signal. By determining which of the 6 icons corresponds to the largest P300, we can determine which of the icons was the target. This paradigm is a simple version of the famous P300 speller [1].\n",
