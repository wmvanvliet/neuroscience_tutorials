    "To apply the inverse model to an [`mne.Evoked`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.Evoked.html) object, use the [`mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse.html) function.\n",
    "It takes two required parameters: the [`mne.Evoked`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.Evoked.html) object object and the inverse solution `inv`.\n",

    "Then, you can use the [`mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse.html) function to transform all four [`mne.Evoked`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.Evoked.html) objects into four [`mne.SourceEstimate`](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/generated/mne.SourceEstimate.html) objects. These objects hold for each of the grid points in the source space, a time course of the estimated current at that point.\n",

    "To get a satisfying plot, it's best to tweak some of the default parameters:\n",
    " * A good time to visualize is 0.08 seconds after the onset of the stimulus, which is the height of the first burst of activity (see the evoked field visualizations). You can do this be specifying `initial_time=0.08`\n",
    " * Set `hemi='both'` so both hemispheres are drawn (be default, only the left hemisphere is shown)\n",
    " * Set `views=['lateral', 'medial', 'caudal']` to draw the brain from multiple angles at the same time.\n",
    " * By default, an \"inflated\" version of the brain is drawn. This is great for peering inside the sulcii. You can also try specifying `surface='white'` to switch the view to the white/gray matter boundary.\n",

    " * Can you trace the responses to checkerboards to the visual cortex?\n",
