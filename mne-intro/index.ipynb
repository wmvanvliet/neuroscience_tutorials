    "The website you are looking at right now is an [interactive Python environment](https://jupyter.org).\n",
    "Through this interface, your laptop is currently talking to some server in the cloud.\n",
    "The server holds the MEG data I've prepared for you and will do the actual computational work, sending the results back to your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we talk with the server is through Python code.\n",
    "That's right, you will do some programming!\n",
    "I'll try to guide you through everything. The learning objective will depend on the knowledge you already have.\n",
    "I have designed multiple paths through this exercise, grouped into three levels.\n",
    "One level ties into the next, so if you want, you can start the next level when you finished one.\n",
